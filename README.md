# Library-Management-System

## Tech Stack Used - HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL

The objective of the library management system project is to create a software application that will simplify the book lending and borrowing process for both students and librarians. The system aims to make the entire process from book issuance to return more organized, efficient, and user-friendly. 

📍The system will allow librarians to easily access book records stored in the database,
which will include information on book titles, 
authors, publication years, and so on. The system will also enable librarians 
to track borrowing and returning activities and maintain records of all 
transactions.

📍When a student borrows a book, the system will record the book's issuance date, the 
student's details, and the expected return date. Students will also be able to 
extend the return date or return a book before the due date using the 
system.

📍In addition, the system will have features that enable the librarian to update, 
edit, delete, and search records quickly and easily, making the whole 
process less cumbersome.
